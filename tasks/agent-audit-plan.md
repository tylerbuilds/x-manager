# Agent-Friendliness Audit: x-manager

## Goal
Audit every API endpoint and interaction surface for AI agent usability. Identify gaps, propose features that reduce friction for Claude Code and OpenClaw.

## Current Phase
Phase 1: Deep exploration of API surface

## Audit Dimensions
- [ ] API completeness (can agents do everything the UI can?)
- [ ] Error response consistency (structured, actionable?)
- [ ] Batch operations (can agents operate at scale?)
- [ ] Account management (programmatic connect/disconnect/status?)
- [ ] Webhook/event support (can agents react to events?)
- [ ] Discovery/readiness (can agents self-orient?)
- [ ] Auth flow (can agents authenticate without browser?)
